      <h2>John Muir</h2>
      <p>"The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness. When one tugs at a single thing in nature, he finds it attached to the rest of the world. The sun shines not on us but in us. The rivers flow not past, but through us, thrilling, tingling, vibrating every fiber and cell of the substance of our bodies, making them glide and sing. The trees wave and the flowers bloom in our bodies as well as our souls, and every bird song, wind song, and tremendous storm song of the rocks in the heart of the mountains is our song, our very own, and sings our love."</p>

      <h2>Rachel Carson</h2>
      <p>"Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth find reserves 
        of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.
         There is something infinitely healing in the repeated
          refrains of natureâ€”the assurance that dawn comes after night,
           and spring after winter. The lasting pleasures of contact with
            the natural world are not reserved for scientists but are available
             to anyone who will place himself under the influence of earth, sea,
              and sky and their amazing life."</p>

      <h2>Henry David Thoreau</h2>
      <p>"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms."</p>
